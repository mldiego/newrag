Only if you use LATEX2ε can hyperlinks be generated in the online\\nversion of your manuscript.\\nIf you are unable to use LATEX, you may use MS Word together with the\\ntemplate sv-lncs.dot (see Sect. 4) or any other text processing system. In the\\nlatter case, please follow these instructions closely in order to make the volume\\nlook as uniform as possible.\\nWe would like to stress that the class/style ﬁles and the template should not\\nbe manipulated and that the guidelines regarding font sizes and format should\\nbe adhered to. This is to ensure that the end product is as homogeneous as\\npossible.\\n2.1 Printing Area\\nThe printing area is 122 mm× 193 mm. The text should be justiﬁed to occupy\\nthefulllinewidth,sothattherightmarginisnotragged,withwordshyphenated\\nas appropriate. Please ﬁll pages so that the length of the text is no less than\\n180 mm.\\n2.2 Layout, Typeface, Font Sizes, and Numbering\\nUse 10-point type for the name(s) of the author(s) and 9-point type for the\\naddress(es) and the abstract. For the main text, please use 10-point type and\\nsingle-line spacing. We recommend using Computer Modern Roman (CM) fonts,\\nTimes,oroneofthesimilartypefaceswidelyusedinphoto-typesetting.(Inthese\\ntypefaces the letters have serifs, i.e., short endstrokes at the head and the foot\\nof letters.) Italic type may be used to emphasize words in running text. Bold\\ntype and underlining should be avoided. With these sizes, the interline distance\\nshould be set so that some 45 lines occur on a full-text page.\\nHeadings. Headings should be capitalized (i.e., nouns, verbs, and all other\\nwordsexceptarticles,prepositions,andconjunctionsshouldbesetwithaninitial\\ncapital) and should, with the exception of the title, be aligned to the left. Words\\njoined by a hyphen are subject to a special rule. If the ﬁrst word can stand alone,\\nthe second word should be capitalized. The font sizes are given in Table 1.\\nHere are some examples of headings: “Criteria to Disprove Context-Freeness\\nofCollageLanguages”,“OnCorrectingtheIntrusionofTracingNon-deterministic\\nPrograms by Software”, “A User-Friendly and Extendable Data Distribution\\nSystem”, “Multi-ﬂip Networks: Parallelizing GenSAT”, “Self-determinations of\\nMan”.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Acrobat Distiller 4.05 for Windows', 'creator': 'DVIPSONE 2.2.1  http://www.YandY.com', 'creationdate': 'D:20020429195111', 'title': \"LNCS/LNAI Authors' Instructions\", 'author': 'Springer-Verlag Heidelberg', 'subject': 'TeX output 2002.04.29:1951', 'moddate': '2002-04-29T20:05:47+02:00', 'source': 'data/LNCS.pdf', 'total_pages': 9, 'page': 2, 'page_label': '3'}, page_content='Lecture Notes in Computer Science 3\\nTable 1.Font sizes of headings.

Grids and details within the ﬁgures must be clearly readable and may\\nnot be written one on top of the other. Line drawings should have a resolution\\nof at least 800 dpi (preferably 1200 dpi). For digital halftones 300 dpi is usually\\nsuﬃcient. The lettering in ﬁgures should have a height of 2 mm (10-point type).\\nFigures should be scaled up or down accordingly. Please do not use any absolute\\ncoordinates in ﬁgures. If possible, the ﬁles of ﬁgures (e.g. PS ﬁles) should not\\ncontain binary data, but be saved in ASCII format.\\nIf you cannot provide your ﬁgures electronically, paste originals into the\\nmanuscript and center them between the margins. For halftone ﬁgures (pho-\\ntos), please forward high-contrast glossy prints and mark the space in the text\\nas well as the back of the photos clearly, so that there can be no doubt about\\nwhere or which way up they should be placed.\\nFigures should be numbered and should have a caption which should always\\nbe positionedunder the ﬁgures, in contrast to the caption belonging to a table,\\nwhich should always appearabove the table. Please center the captions between\\nthemarginsandsetthemin9-pointtype(Fig.1showsanexample).Thedistance\\nbetween text and ﬁgure should be about 8 mm, the distance between ﬁgure and\\ncaption about 5 mm.\\nIf possible (e.g. if you use L\\nATEX) please deﬁne ﬁgures as ﬂoating objects.\\nLATEX users, please avoid using the location parameter “h” for “here”.

    "Michael Jeffrey Jordan (born February 17, 1963), also known by his initials MJ,[8] is an American businessman, former professional basketball and baseball player, who is a minority owner of the Charlotte Hornets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played 15 seasons in the NBA between 1984-2003, winning six NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls. Widely considered to be one of the greatest players of all time,[9][10][11] he was integral in popularizing basketball and the NBA around the world in the 1980s and 1990s,[12] becoming a global cultural icon.[13]\n",
    "\n",
    "Jordan played college basketball with the North Carolina Tar Heels.

      "Michael Jeffrey Jordan (born February 17, 1963), also known by his initials MJ,[8] is an American businessman, former professional basketball and baseball player, who is a minority owner of the Charlotte Hornets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played 15 seasons in the NBA between 1984-2003, winning six NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls. Widely considered to be one of the greatest players of all time,[9][10][11] he was integral in popularizing basketball and the NBA around the world in the 1980s and 1990s,[12] becoming a global cultural icon.[13]\n",
      "\n",
      "Jordan played college basketball with the North Carolina Tar Heels. As a freshman, he was a member of the Tar Heels' national championship team in 1982.[5] Jordan joined the Bulls in 1984 as the third overall draft pick[5][14] and emerged as a league star, entertaining crowds with his prolific scoring while gaining a reputation as one of the best defensive players.[15] His leaping ability, demonstrated by performing slam dunks from the free-throw line in Slam Dunk Contests, earned him the nicknames \"Air Jordan\" and \"His Airness\".[5] Jordan won his first NBA title with the Bulls in 1991 and followed that with titles in 1992 and 1993, securing a three-peat. Citing physical and mental exhaustion from basketball and superstardom, Jordan abruptly retired before the 1993–94 NBA season to play Minor League Baseball in the Chicago White Sox organization. He returned to the Bulls in 1995 and led them to three more championships in 1996, 1997, and 1998, as well as a then-record 72 regular season wins in the 1995–96 NBA season.[5] Jordan retired for the second time in 1999, returning for two NBA seasons from 2001 to 2003 as a member of the Washington Wizards.[5][14] He was selected to play for the United States national team during his college and NBA careers, winning four gold medals—at the 1983 Pan American Games, 1984 Summer Olympics, 1992 Tournament of the Americas and 1992 Summer Olympics—while also being undefeated.[16]\n",
      "\n",
      "Jordan's individual accolades include six NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) awards, ten NBA scoring titles (both all-time records), five NBA MVP awards, 10 All-NBA First Team designations, nine All-Defensive First Team honors, fourteen NBA All-Star Game selections, three NBA All-Star Game MVP awards, and three NBA steals titles.[14] He holds the NBA records for career regular season scoring average (30.1 points per game) and career playoff scoring average (33.4 points per game).[17] He is one of only eight players to achieve the basketball Triple Crown. In 1999, Jordan was named the 20th century's greatest North American athlete by ESPN and was second to Babe Ruth on the Associated Press' list of athletes of the century.[5] Jordan was twice inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, once in 2009 for his individual career,[18] and in 2010 as part of the 1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team (\"The Dream Team\").[19] He became a member of the United States Olympic Hall of Fame in 2009,[20] an individual member of the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2015 and a \"Dream Team\" member in 2017.[21][22] Jordan was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021.[23] The trophy for the NBA Most Valuable Player Award is named in his honor. One of the most effectively marketed athletes ever, Jordan made many product endorsements.[12][24] He fueled the success of Nike's Air Jordan sneakers, which were introduced in 1984 and remain popular.[25] Jordan starred as himself in the live-action/animation hybrid film Space Jam (1996) and was the focus of the Emmy-winning documentary series The Last Dance (2020). He became part-owner and head of basketball operations for the Charlotte Hornets (then named the Bobcats) in 2006 and bought a controlling interest in 2010, before selling his majority stake in 2023.\"): 0.7597728\n",

    "1.0 INTRODUCTION AND SCOPE\n",
    "\n",
    "This document, S065-B/SRD, defines the mandatory technical specifications and operational protocols for the secure, automated transfer of clinical trial data between sponsor systems and the central regulatory body's database. The scope of this standard encompasses all data streams related to Protocol 734-X, specifically focusing on patient-reported outcomes (PROs), adverse event reporting (AERs), and investigational product accountability (IPA) logs. All data exchanges must be formatted in accordance with the HL7 FHIR standard, version R4, with specific profiles as detailed in Section 3.2. Data integrity is paramount, and non-compliance with these specifications will result in an automated rejection of the data submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.0 DATA TRANSFER PROTOCOLS\n",
    "\n",
    "2.1 Security and Authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "All connections must be established via a TLS 1.3 encrypted channel. Each data stream must be accompanied by a digital signature using an SHA-256 hash and a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificate issued by the approved Certificate Authority (CA) as designated in Appendix A. Client-side authentication requires a valid client certificate and a rotating API key, which must be refreshed every 24 hours. Failure to authenticate correctly will terminate the connection and log a security event in the central audit trail.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.2 File Transmission and Archiving\n",

      "TITLE: S065-B/SRD — Automated System Interface and Data Validation Standard, Revision 2.1\n",
      "\n",
      "1.0 INTRODUCTION AND SCOPE\n",
      "\n",
      "This document, S065-B/SRD, defines the mandatory technical specifications and operational protocols for the secure, automated transfer of clinical trial data between sponsor systems and the central regulatory body's database. The scope of this standard encompasses all data streams related to Protocol 734-X, specifically focusing on patient-reported outcomes (PROs), adverse event reporting (AERs), and investigational product accountability (IPA) logs. All data exchanges must be formatted in accordance with the HL7 FHIR standard, version R4, with specific profiles as detailed in Section 3.2. Data integrity is paramount, and non-compliance with these specifications will result in an automated rejection of the data submission. 2.0 DATA TRANSFER PROTOCOLS\n",
      "\n",
      "2.1 Security and Authentication\n",
      "\n",
      "All connections must be established via a TLS 1.3 encrypted channel. Each data stream must be accompanied by a digital signature using an SHA-256 hash and a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificate issued by the approved Certificate Authority (CA) as designated in Appendix A. Client-side authentication requires a valid client certificate and a rotating API key, which must be refreshed every 24 hours. Failure to authenticate correctly will terminate the connection and log a security event in the central audit trail. 2.2 File Transmission and Archiving\n",
      "\n",
      "Data payloads shall be transmitted as a compressed JSON file, with a maximum size of 50 MB per transmission. Submissions exceeding this limit must be partitioned into multiple files. Upon successful receipt, the system will generate a unique transaction ID and archive the file for a period of no less than seven (7) years. The sponsor is responsible for retaining a local copy of all submitted data and the corresponding transaction IDs. 3.0 DATA CONTENT AND VALIDATION\n",
      "\n",
      "3.1 Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs)\n",
      "\n",
      "PRO data must adhere to the CDISC SDTM standard, version 1.6. Each record must include a unique patient identifier, the date of response, and the specific instrument used (e.g., EQ-5D-5L, QLQ-C30).\"): 0.7835642\n",

Any out-of-range values will be flagged, and the entire batch will be returned for correction with a detailed error report. 3.2 Adverse Event Reporting (AERs)\n",
      "\n",
      "AER data submissions must use the MedDRA coding system for all adverse events, up to the lowest level of term (LLT). Each report must include the event onset date, severity, and a causality assessment in relation to the investigational product. The system will cross-reference all submitted AERs against a predefined list of high-priority events and will automatically trigger a critical alert for immediate manual review if a match is found. 3.3 Investigational Product Accountability (IPA) Logs\n",
