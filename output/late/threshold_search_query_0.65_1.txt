TITLE: S065-B/SRD â€” Automated System Interface and Data Validation Standard, Revision 2.1

1.0 INTRODUCTION AND SCOPE

This document, S065-B/SRD, defines the mandatory technical specifications and operational protocols for the secure, automated transfer of clinical trial data between sponsor systems and the central regulatory body's database.
 - 

2.2 File Transmission and Archiving

Data payloads shall be transmitted as a compressed JSON file, with a maximum size of 50 MB per transmission.
 -  The scope of this standard encompasses all data streams related to Protocol 734-X, specifically focusing on patient-reported outcomes (PROs), adverse event reporting (AERs), and investigational product accountability (IPA) logs.
 -  Non-compliance with this standard, including but not limited to repeated failed submissions or data integrity issues, may lead to a formal investigation and potential suspension of the sponsor's data submission privileges.
 -  Client-side authentication requires a valid client certificate and a rotating API key, which must be refreshed every 24 hours.
 -  Failure to authenticate correctly will terminate the connection and log a security event in the central audit trail.
 -  Submissions exceeding this limit must be partitioned into multiple files.
 -  Each record must include a unique patient identifier, the date of response, and the specific instrument used (e.g., EQ-5D-5L, QLQ-C30).
 -  Upon successful receipt, the system will generate a unique transaction ID and archive the file for a period of no less than seven (7) years.
 -  This document supersedes and replaces all previous versions of S065-A/SRD.
 -  Failure to provide a valid justification will result in an official compliance notice.
 -  The sponsor is responsible for retaining a local copy of all submitted data and the corresponding transaction IDs.
 -  Any changes will be communicated via official channels and will be published with a 90-day grace period before mandatory enforcement.
 -  A logical check will be performed to ensure that all response values fall within the permissible range for the specified instrument.
 - 

4.0 GOVERNANCE AND COMPLIANCE

This standard is subject to periodic review and revision.
 -  Any discrepancy greater than a 2% variance must be justified in a separate discrepancy report submitted alongside the data.
 -  Any out-of-range values will be flagged, and the entire batch will be returned for correction with a detailed error report.
 -  The system will cross-reference all submitted AERs against a predefined list of high-priority events and will automatically trigger a critical alert for immediate manual review if a match is found.
 -  The data must include the batch number, expiration date, and a detailed record of the product dispensed, returned, or destroyed.
 -  All quantities must be reconciled with the initial shipment manifest.
 - 

3.3 Investigational Product Accountability (IPA) Logs

IPA logs are required to be submitted on a monthly basis.
 - 

3.2 Adverse Event Reporting (AERs)

AER data submissions must use the MedDRA coding system for all adverse events, up to the lowest level of term (LLT).
 -  Each report must include the event onset date, severity, and a causality assessment in relation to the investigational product.
 -  Within artificial intelligence, computer vision aims to understand and process image and video data, while natural language processing aims to understand and process textual and linguistic data.


ANSWER

The data content and validation for S065-B/SRD are as follows:

1. **Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs)**:
   - PRO data must adhere to the **CDISC SDTM standard, version 1.6**.
   - Each record must include:
     - A unique patient identifier.
     - The date of response.
     - The specific instrument used (e.g., EQ-5D-5L, QLQ-C30).
   - A **logical check** is performed to ensure that all response values fall within the permissible range for the specified instrument.

2. **Adverse Event Reporting (AERs)**:
   - AER data submissions must use the **MedDRA coding system** for all adverse events, up to the **lowest level of term (LLT)**.
   - Each report must include:
     - The event onset date.
     - Severity.
     - A causality assessment in relation to the investigational product.
   - The system will **cross-reference all submitted AERs** against a predefined list of high-priority events and will **automatically trigger a critical alert** for immediate manual review if a match is found.
   - Any **out-of-range values** will be flagged, and the entire batch will be returned for correction with a detailed error report.
   - Any discrepancy greater than a **2% variance** must be justified in a separate discrepancy report submitted alongside the data.

3. **Investigational Product Accountability (IPA) Logs**:
   - IPA logs are required to be submitted on a **monthly basis**.
   - The data must include:
     - The batch number.
     - Expiration date.
     - A detailed record of the product dispensed, returned, or destroyed.
   - All quantities must be **reconciled with the initial shipment manifest**.

4. **General Data Validation and Integrity**:
   - All data exchanges must be formatted in accordance with the **HL7 FHIR standard, version R4**, with specific profiles as detailed in Section 3.2.
   - Data integrity is paramount; non-compliance results in automated rejection of the submission.
   - Submissions exceeding the 50 MB limit per file must be **partitioned into multiple files**.
   - Upon successful receipt, the system generates a unique transaction ID and archives the file for a minimum of **seven (7) years**.
   - The sponsor is responsible for retaining a local copy of all submitted data and corresponding transaction IDs.

5. **Compliance and Governance**:
   - The standard supersedes all previous versions of S065-A/SRD.
   - Non-compliance, including repeated failed submissions or data integrity issues, may lead to a formal investigation and potential suspension of the sponsor's data submission privileges.
   - Failure to provide a valid justification results in an official compliance notice.
   - Changes to the standard will be communicated via official channels and will be published with a 90-day grace period before mandatory enforcement.

In summary, S065-B/SRD establishes strict technical and validation requirements for clinical trial data (PROs, AERs, IPA logs), ensuring consistency, accuracy, and traceability through standardized formats, mandatory fields, logical checks, and compliance enforcement.
