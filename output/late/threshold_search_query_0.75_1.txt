 -  All data exchanges must be formatted in accordance with the HL7 FHIR standard, version R4, with specific profiles as detailed in Section 3.2.
 -  Data integrity is paramount, and non-compliance with these specifications will result in an automated rejection of the data submission.
 -  Each data stream must be accompanied by a digital signature using an SHA-256 hash and a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificate issued by the approved Certificate Authority (CA) as designated in Appendix A.

TITLE: S065-B/SRD â€” Automated System Interface and Data Validation Standard, Revision 2.1

1.0 INTRODUCTION AND SCOPE

This document, S065-B/SRD, defines the mandatory technical specifications and operational protocols for the secure, automated transfer of clinical trial data between sponsor systems and the central regulatory body's database.
 - 

2.2 File Transmission and Archiving

Data payloads shall be transmitted as a compressed JSON file, with a maximum size of 50 MB per transmission.
 -  The scope of this standard encompasses all data streams related to Protocol 734-X, specifically focusing on patient-reported outcomes (PROs), adverse event reporting (AERs), and investigational product accountability (IPA) logs.
 -  Non-compliance with this standard, including but not limited to repeated failed submissions or data integrity issues, may lead to a formal investigation and potential suspension of the sponsor's data submission privileges.
 -  Client-side authentication requires a valid client certificate and a rotating API key, which must be refreshed every 24 hours.
 -  Failure to authenticate correctly will terminate the connection and log a security event in the central audit trail.
 -  Submissions exceeding this limit must be partitioned into multiple files.
 -  Each record must include a unique patient identifier, the date of response, and the specific instrument used (e.g., EQ-5D-5L, QLQ-C30).
 -  Upon successful receipt, the system will generate a unique transaction ID and archive the file for a period of no less than seven (7) years.
 -  This document supersedes and replaces all previous versions of S065-A/SRD.
 -  Failure to provide a valid justification will result in an official compliance notice.
 -  The sponsor is responsible for retaining a local copy of all submitted data and the corresponding transaction IDs.
 -  Any changes will be communicated via official channels and will be published with a 90-day grace period before mandatory enforcement.
 -  A logical check will be performed to ensure that all response values fall within the permissible range for the specified instrument.
 - 

4.0 GOVERNANCE AND COMPLIANCE

This standard is subject to periodic review and revision.
 -  Any discrepancy greater than a 2% variance must be justified in a separate discrepancy report submitted alongside the data.
 -  Any out-of-range values will be flagged, and the entire batch will be returned for correction with a detailed error report.


ANSWER

The data content and validation for S065-B/SRD are defined as follows:

**Data Content:**
- The scope of the standard includes data streams related to **Protocol 734-X**, specifically focusing on:
  - **Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs)**
  - Adverse event reporting (AERs)
  - Investigational product accountability (IPA) logs
- For **Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs)**, data must adhere to the **CDISC SDTM standard, version 1.6**.
- Each data record must include:
  - A **unique patient identifier**
  - The **date of response**
  - The **specific instrument used** (e.g., EQ-5D-5L, QLQ-C30)

**Data Validation:**
- A **logical check** is performed to ensure that all response values fall within the permissible range for the specified instrument.
- Any **out-of-range values** will be flagged, and the entire batch will be returned for correction with a detailed error report.
- Any **discrepancy greater than a 2% variance** must be justified in a separate discrepancy report submitted alongside the data.
- Data integrity is paramount, and non-compliance with specifications will result in an automated rejection of the data submission.

Additionally, all data exchanges must be formatted in accordance with the **HL7 FHIR standard, version R4**, with specific profiles as detailed in Section 3.2.
