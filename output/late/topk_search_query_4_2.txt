User query/keyword: What are the main branches of computer science?
Threshold/topK: 4


Chunks: 
 -  Areas such as operating systems, networks and embedded systems investigate the principles and design behind complex systems.
 -  Computer architecture describes the construction of computer components and computer-operated equipment.
 -  Human–computer interaction investigates the interfaces through which humans and computers interact, and software engineering focuses on the design and principles behind developing software.
 -  Computer science spans theoretical disciplines (such as algorithms, theory of computation, and information theory) to applied disciplines (including the design and implementation of hardware and software).


ANSWER

The main branches of computer science include:

1. **Theoretical disciplines**: Such as algorithms, theory of computation, and information theory.  
2. **Applied disciplines**: Including the design and implementation of hardware and software.  
3. **Specific areas**:  
   - Operating systems  
   - Networks  
   - Embedded systems  
   - Human–computer interaction  
   - Software engineering  

These branches span both theoretical foundations and practical applications in computing systems.
