Threshold/topK: 5


Chunks: 
 -  Areas such as operating systems, networks and embedded systems investigate the principles and design behind complex systems.
 -  Computer architecture describes the construction of computer components and computer-operated equipment.
 -  Human–computer interaction investigates the interfaces through which humans and computers interact, and software engineering focuses on the design and principles behind developing software.
 -  Computer science spans theoretical disciplines (such as algorithms, theory of computation, and information theory) to applied disciplines (including the design and implementation of hardware and software).
 -  Artificial intelligence and machine learning aim to synthesize goal-orientated processes such as problem-solving, decision-making, environmental adaptation, planning and learning found in humans and animals.
