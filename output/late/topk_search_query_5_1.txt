ANSWER

The provided context does not contain any information about data content and validation for "s065." While it mentions data content and validation for Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) in accordance with the CDISC SDTM standard, version 1.6, there is no reference to a data element or category designated as "s065."

Therefore, based on the given information, I cannot describe data content and validation for s065.
