ANSWER

The main branches of computer science include:

1. **Theory of Computation** – Concerns abstract models of computation and general classes of problems that can be solved using them.
2. **Algorithms and Data Structures** – Central to computer science, focusing on efficient problem-solving methods and data organization.
3. **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning** – Aim to synthesize goal-orientated processes such as problem-solving, decision-making, environmental adaptation, planning, and learning found in humans and animals. Subfields include:
   - **Computer Vision** – Understanding and processing image and video data.
   - **Natural Language Processing** – Understanding and processing textual and linguistic data.
4. **Programming Language Theory** – Considers different ways to describe computational processes.
5. **Database Theory** – Concerns the management of repositories of data.
6. **Computer Architecture** – Describes the construction of computer components and computer-operated equipment.
7. **Operating Systems, Networks, and Embedded Systems** – Investigate the principles and design behind complex systems.
8. **Human–Computer Interaction** – Studies interfaces through which humans and computers interact.
9. **Software Engineering** – Focuses on the design and principles behind developing software.
10. **Cryptography and Computer Security** – Studies means for secure communication and preventing security vulnerabilities.
11. **Computer Graphics and Computational Geometry** – Address the generation of images.

Additionally, computer science spans theoretical disciplines (such as algorithms, theory of computation, and information theory) to applied disciplines (including the design and implementation of hardware and software), and its fundamental concern is determining what can and cannot be automated.
