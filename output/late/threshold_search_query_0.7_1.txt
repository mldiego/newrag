Chunks: 
 -  All data exchanges must be formatted in accordance with the HL7 FHIR standard, version R4, with specific profiles as detailed in Section 3.2.
 -  Data integrity is paramount, and non-compliance with these specifications will result in an automated rejection of the data submission.
 -  Each data stream must be accompanied by a digital signature using an SHA-256 hash and a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificate issued by the approved Certificate Authority (CA) as designated in Appendix A.

TITLE: S065-B/SRD â€” Automated System Interface and Data Validation Standard, Revision 2.1

1.0 INTRODUCTION AND SCOPE

This document, S065-B/SRD, defines the mandatory technical specifications and operational protocols for the secure, automated transfer of clinical trial data between sponsor systems and the central regulatory body's database.
 - 

2.2 File Transmission and Archiving

Data payloads shall be transmitted as a compressed JSON file, with a maximum size of 50 MB per transmission.
 -  The scope of this standard encompasses all data streams related to Protocol 734-X, specifically focusing on patient-reported outcomes (PROs), adverse event reporting (AERs), and investigational product accountability (IPA) logs.
 -  Non-compliance with this standard, including but not limited to repeated failed submissions or data integrity issues, may lead to a formal investigation and potential suspension of the sponsor's data submission privileges.
 -  Client-side authentication requires a valid client certificate and a rotating API key, which must be refreshed every 24 hours.
 -  Failure to authenticate correctly will terminate the connection and log a security event in the central audit trail.
 -  Submissions exceeding this limit must be partitioned into multiple files.
 -  Each record must include a unique patient identifier, the date of response, and the specific instrument used (e.g., EQ-5D-5L, QLQ-C30).
 -  Upon successful receipt, the system will generate a unique transaction ID and archive the file for a period of no less than seven (7) years.
 -  This document supersedes and replaces all previous versions of S065-A/SRD.
 -  Failure to provide a valid justification will result in an official compliance notice.
 -  The sponsor is responsible for retaining a local copy of all submitted data and the corresponding transaction IDs.
 -  Any changes will be communicated via official channels and will be published with a 90-day grace period before mandatory enforcement.
 -  A logical check will be performed to ensure that all response values fall within the permissible range for the specified instrument.
 - 

4.0 GOVERNANCE AND COMPLIANCE

This standard is subject to periodic review and revision.
 -  Any discrepancy greater than a 2% variance must be justified in a separate discrepancy report submitted alongside the data.
 -  Any out-of-range values will be flagged, and the entire batch will be returned for correction with a detailed error report.
 -  The system will cross-reference all submitted AERs against a predefined list of high-priority events and will automatically trigger a critical alert for immediate manual review if a match is found.
 -  The data must include the batch number, expiration date, and a detailed record of the product dispensed, returned, or destroyed.
 -  All quantities must be reconciled with the initial shipment manifest.
 - 

3.3 Investigational Product Accountability (IPA) Logs

IPA logs are required to be submitted on a monthly basis.
 - 

3.2 Adverse Event Reporting (AERs)

AER data submissions must use the MedDRA coding system for all adverse events, up to the lowest level of term (LLT).
 -  Each report must include the event onset date, severity, and a causality assessment in relation to the investigational product.


ANSWER

The data content and validation for the S065-B/SRD standard are as follows:

**1. Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs):**  
- PRO data must adhere to the **CDISC SDTM standard, version 1.6**.  
- Each record must include a **unique patient identifier**, the **date of response**, and the **specific instrument used** (e.g., EQ-5D-5L, QLQ-C30).  
- A **logical check** is performed to ensure that all response values fall within the permissible range for the specified instrument.

**2. Adverse Event Reporting (AERs):**  
- AER data submissions must use the **MedDRA coding system** for all adverse events, up to the **lowest level of term (LLT)**.  
- Each report must include the **event onset date**, **severity**, and a **causality assessment** in relation to the investigational product.  
- The system will **cross-reference all submitted AERs** against a predefined list of high-priority events and will **automatically trigger a critical alert** for immediate manual review if a match is found.  
- Any **out-of-range values** will be flagged, and the entire batch will be returned for correction with a detailed error report.  
- Any discrepancy greater than a **2% variance** must be **justified in a separate discrepancy report** submitted alongside the data.

**3. Investigational Product Accountability (IPA) Logs:**  
- IPA logs are required to be submitted on a **monthly basis**.  
- The data must include the **batch number**, **expiration date**, and a **detailed record** of the product dispensed, returned, or destroyed.  
- All quantities must be **reconciled with the initial shipment manifest**.

**Data Integrity and Validation:**  
- All data exchanges must be formatted in accordance with the **HL7 FHIR standard, version R4**, with specific profiles as detailed in Section 3.2.  
- Non-compliance with these specifications will result in an **automated rejection** of the data submission.  
- Data must be validated for consistency, range, and compliance with defined standards before acceptance.

**Submission Requirements:**  
- Data payloads are transmitted as a **compressed JSON file**, with a **maximum size of 50 MB per transmission**.  
- Submissions exceeding this limit must be **partitioned into multiple files**.  
- Upon successful receipt, the system generates a **unique transaction ID** and archives the file for a period of **no less than seven (7) years**.  
- The sponsor is responsible for retaining a **local copy** of all submitted data and the corresponding transaction IDs.

This standard supersedes all previous versions of S065-A/SRD and is subject to periodic review and revision. Any changes will be communicated via official channels with a 90-day grace period before mandatory enforcement. Failure to provide a valid justification will result in an official compliance notice.
