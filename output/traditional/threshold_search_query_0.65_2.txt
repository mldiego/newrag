Chunks: 
 -  Computer science spans theoretical disciplines (such as algorithms, theory of computation, and information theory) to applied disciplines (including the design and implementation of hardware and software).
 - 
Computer science is the study of computation, information, and automation.
 -  Algorithms and data structures are central to computer science.
 -  The fundamental concern of computer science is determining what can and cannot be automated.The Turing Award is generally recognized as the highest distinction in computer science.
 -  Areas such as operating systems, networks and embedded systems investigate the principles and design behind complex systems.
 -  Human–computer interaction investigates the interfaces through which humans and computers interact, and software engineering focuses on the design and principles behind developing software.
 -  The theory of computation concerns abstract models of computation and general classes of problems that can be solved using them.
 -  The fields of cryptography and computer security involve studying the means for secure communication and preventing security vulnerabilities.
 -  Computer architecture describes the construction of computer components and computer-operated equipment.
 -  Programming language theory considers different ways to describe computational processes, and database theory concerns the management of repositories of data.
 -  Artificial intelligence and machine learning aim to synthesize goal-orientated processes such as problem-solving, decision-making, environmental adaptation, planning and learning found in humans and animals.
 -  Within artificial intelligence, computer vision aims to understand and process image and video data, while natural language processing aims to understand and process textual and linguistic data.
 -  Computer graphics and computational geometry address the generation of images.
 -  The scope of this standard encompasses all data streams related to Protocol 734-X, specifically focusing on patient-reported outcomes (PROs), adverse event reporting (AERs), and investigational product accountability (IPA) logs.
