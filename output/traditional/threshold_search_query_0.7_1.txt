TITLE: S065-B/SRD â€” Automated System Interface and Data Validation Standard, Revision 2.1

1.0 INTRODUCTION AND SCOPE

This document, S065-B/SRD, defines the mandatory technical specifications and operational protocols for the secure, automated transfer of clinical trial data between sponsor systems and the central regulatory body's database.
 - 

3.0 DATA CONTENT AND VALIDATION

3.1 Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs)

PRO data must adhere to the CDISC SDTM standard, version 1.6.
 -  All data exchanges must be formatted in accordance with the HL7 FHIR standard, version R4, with specific profiles as detailed in Section 3.2.
 -  This document supersedes and replaces all previous versions of S065-A/SRD.
 -  Data integrity is paramount, and non-compliance with these specifications will result in an automated rejection of the data submission.
 -  Non-compliance with this standard, including but not limited to repeated failed submissions or data integrity issues, may lead to a formal investigation and potential suspension of the sponsor's data submission privileges.
 -  The data must include the batch number, expiration date, and a detailed record of the product dispensed, returned, or destroyed.
 -  The scope of this standard encompasses all data streams related to Protocol 734-X, specifically focusing on patient-reported outcomes (PROs), adverse event reporting (AERs), and investigational product accountability (IPA) logs.
 -  Each data stream must be accompanied by a digital signature using an SHA-256 hash and a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificate issued by the approved Certificate Authority (CA) as designated in Appendix A.
 -  A logical check will be performed to ensure that all response values fall within the permissible range for the specified instrument.
 -  Any out-of-range values will be flagged, and the entire batch will be returned for correction with a detailed error report.
 -  Each record must include a unique patient identifier, the date of response, and the specific instrument used (e.g., EQ-5D-5L, QLQ-C30).
 -  Any discrepancy greater than a 2% variance must be justified in a separate discrepancy report submitted alongside the data.
 -  Failure to provide a valid justification will result in an official compliance notice.
 - 

2.2 File Transmission and Archiving

Data payloads shall be transmitted as a compressed JSON file, with a maximum size of 50 MB per transmission.
 - 

4.0 GOVERNANCE AND COMPLIANCE

This standard is subject to periodic review and revision.


ANSWER

The data content and validation for S065-B/SRD are as follows:

1. **Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs)**:
   - PRO data must adhere to the CDISC SDTM standard, version 1.6.

2. **Data Format and Standardization**:
   - All data exchanges must be formatted in accordance with the HL7 FHIR standard, version R4, with specific profiles detailed in Section 3.2.

3. **Data Content Requirements**:
   - Each record must include a unique patient identifier, the date of response, and the specific instrument used (e.g., EQ-5D-5L, QLQ-C3-0).
   - The data must include the batch number, expiration date, and a detailed record of the product dispensed, returned, or destroyed.
   - The scope of this standard includes all data streams related to Protocol 734-X, specifically focusing on patient-reported outcomes (PROs), adverse event reporting (AERs), and investigational product accountability (IPA) logs.

4. **Validation and Integrity Checks**:
   - A logical check ensures that all response values fall within the permissible range for the specified instrument. Any out-of-range values will be flagged, and the entire batch will be returned for correction with a detailed error report.
   - Any discrepancy greater than a 2% variance must be justified in a separate discrepancy report submitted alongside the data. Failure to provide a valid justification will result in an official compliance notice.
   - Data integrity is paramount, and non-compliance with these specifications will result in an automated rejection of the data submission.

5. **Security and Authentication**:
   - Each data stream must be accompanied by a digital signature using an SHA-256 hash and a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificate issued by the approved Certificate Authority (CA) as designated in Appendix A.

6. **Transmission Requirements**:
   - Data payloads shall be transmitted as a compressed JSON file, with a maximum size of 50 MB per transmission.

7. **Compliance and Consequences**:
   - Non-compliance with this standard, including but not limited to repeated failed submissions or data integrity issues, may lead to a formal investigation and potential suspension of the sponsor's data submission privileges.

This standard supersedes all previous versions of S065-A/SRD and is subject to periodic review and revision.
