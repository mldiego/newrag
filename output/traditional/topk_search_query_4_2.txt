Chunks: 
 -  Computer science spans theoretical disciplines (such as algorithms, theory of computation, and information theory) to applied disciplines (including the design and implementation of hardware and software).
 - 
Computer science is the study of computation, information, and automation.
 -  Algorithms and data structures are central to computer science.
 -  The fundamental concern of computer science is determining what can and cannot be automated.The Turing Award is generally recognized as the highest distinction in computer science.


ANSWER

The provided context does not explicitly list or define the main branches of computer science. It mentions that computer science spans theoretical disciplines (such as algorithms, theory of computation, and information theory) to applied disciplines (including the design and implementation of hardware and software), and highlights that algorithms and data structures are central. It also notes the fundamental concern of determining what can and cannot be automated and references the Turing Award as the highest distinction in the field.

However, based on the information given, the main branches can be inferred as:

- Theoretical disciplines (e.g., algorithms, theory of computation, information theory)
- Applied disciplines (e.g., design and implementation of hardware and software)

But these are not directly stated as "branches" in the text. Therefore, the exact list of main branches is not explicitly provided in the context.
