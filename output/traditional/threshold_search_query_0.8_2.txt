Chunks: 
 -  Computer science spans theoretical disciplines (such as algorithms, theory of computation, and information theory) to applied disciplines (including the design and implementation of hardware and software).
 - 
Computer science is the study of computation, information, and automation.
 -  Algorithms and data structures are central to computer science.
 -  The fundamental concern of computer science is determining what can and cannot be automated.The Turing Award is generally recognized as the highest distinction in computer science.


ANSWER

The provided context does not explicitly list or define the main branches of computer science. It mentions that computer science spans theoretical disciplines (such as algorithms, theory of computation, and information theory) to applied disciplines (including the design and implementation of hardware and software), and highlights that algorithms and data structures are central. It also notes the fundamental concern of determining what can and cannot be automated and references the Turing Award as the highest distinction in the field.

However, based solely on the given text, there is no clear enumeration or identification of the main branches of computer science. Therefore, the main branches cannot be determined from the provided information.
