Threshold/topK: 0.75


Chunks: 
 -  Computer science spans theoretical disciplines (such as algorithms, theory of computation, and information theory) to applied disciplines (including the design and implementation of hardware and software).
 - 
Computer science is the study of computation, information, and automation.
 -  Algorithms and data structures are central to computer science.
 -  The fundamental concern of computer science is determining what can and cannot be automated.The Turing Award is generally recognized as the highest distinction in computer science.
 -  Areas such as operating systems, networks and embedded systems investigate the principles and design behind complex systems.
 -  Human–computer interaction investigates the interfaces through which humans and computers interact, and software engineering focuses on the design and principles behind developing software.


ANSWER

The provided context does not explicitly list the main branches of computer science. However, it does mention several key areas, such as:

- Algorithms and data structures  
- Theory of computation and information theory (theoretical disciplines)  
- Design and implementation of hardware and software (applied disciplines)  
- Operating systems  
- Networks  
- Embedded systems  
- Human–computer interaction  
- Software engineering  

While these areas are central to computer science, the context does not present a formal or comprehensive list of the main branches. Therefore, based solely on the provided information, a definitive list of main branches cannot be established.
