User query/keyword: What are the main branches of computer science?
Threshold/topK: 5


Chunks: 
 -  Computer science spans theoretical disciplines (such as algorithms, theory of computation, and information theory) to applied disciplines (including the design and implementation of hardware and software).
 - 
Computer science is the study of computation, information, and automation.
 -  Algorithms and data structures are central to computer science.
 -  The fundamental concern of computer science is determining what can and cannot be automated.The Turing Award is generally recognized as the highest distinction in computer science.
 -  Areas such as operating systems, networks and embedded systems investigate the principles and design behind complex systems.


ANSWER

The provided context does not explicitly list or define the main branches of computer science. It mentions key areas such as algorithms, data structures, operating systems, networks, and embedded systems, and highlights theoretical and applied disciplines, as well as automation. However, it does not clearly outline the main branches of computer science.

Therefore, based solely on the given context, I cannot identify or list the main branches of computer science.
