TITLE: S065-B/SRD — Automated System Interface and Data Validation Standard, Revision 2.1

1.0 INTRODUCTION AND SCOPE

This document, S065-B/SRD, defines the mandatory technical specifications and operational protocols for the secure, automated transfer of clinical trial data between sponsor systems and the central regulatory body's database.
 - 

3.0 DATA CONTENT AND VALIDATION

3.1 Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs)

PRO data must adhere to the CDISC SDTM standard, version 1.6.
 -  All data exchanges must be formatted in accordance with the HL7 FHIR standard, version R4, with specific profiles as detailed in Section 3.2.
 -  This document supersedes and replaces all previous versions of S065-A/SRD.
 -  Data integrity is paramount, and non-compliance with these specifications will result in an automated rejection of the data submission.
 -  Non-compliance with this standard, including but not limited to repeated failed submissions or data integrity issues, may lead to a formal investigation and potential suspension of the sponsor's data submission privileges.
 -  The data must include the batch number, expiration date, and a detailed record of the product dispensed, returned, or destroyed.
 -  The scope of this standard encompasses all data streams related to Protocol 734-X, specifically focusing on patient-reported outcomes (PROs), adverse event reporting (AERs), and investigational product accountability (IPA) logs.
 -  Each data stream must be accompanied by a digital signature using an SHA-256 hash and a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificate issued by the approved Certificate Authority (CA) as designated in Appendix A.
 -  A logical check will be performed to ensure that all response values fall within the permissible range for the specified instrument.
 -  Any out-of-range values will be flagged, and the entire batch will be returned for correction with a detailed error report.
 -  Each record must include a unique patient identifier, the date of response, and the specific instrument used (e.g., EQ-5D-5L, QLQ-C30).
 -  Any discrepancy greater than a 2% variance must be justified in a separate discrepancy report submitted alongside the data.
 -  Failure to provide a valid justification will result in an official compliance notice.
 - 

2.2 File Transmission and Archiving

Data payloads shall be transmitted as a compressed JSON file, with a maximum size of 50 MB per transmission.
 - 

4.0 GOVERNANCE AND COMPLIANCE

This standard is subject to periodic review and revision.
 - 

2.0 DATA TRANSFER PROTOCOLS

2.1 Security and Authentication

All connections must be established via a TLS 1.3 encrypted channel.
 -  Upon successful receipt, the system will generate a unique transaction ID and archive the file for a period of no less than seven (7) years.
 - 

3.2 Adverse Event Reporting (AERs)

AER data submissions must use the MedDRA coding system for all adverse events, up to the lowest level of term (LLT).
 -  The sponsor is responsible for retaining a local copy of all submitted data and the corresponding transaction IDs.
 -  Submissions exceeding this limit must be partitioned into multiple files.
 -  Any changes will be communicated via official channels and will be published with a 90-day grace period before mandatory enforcement.
 - 

3.3 Investigational Product Accountability (IPA) Logs

IPA logs are required to be submitted on a monthly basis.
 -  Algorithms and data structures are central to computer science.
 -  The system will cross-reference all submitted AERs against a predefined list of high-priority events and will automatically trigger a critical alert for immediate manual review if a match is found.
 -  The fundamental concern of computer science is determining what can and cannot be automated.The Turing Award is generally recognized as the highest distinction in computer science.
 -  Client-side authentication requires a valid client certificate and a rotating API key, which must be refreshed every 24 hours.
 -  Areas such as operating systems, networks and embedded systems investigate the principles and design behind complex systems.
 -  Failure to authenticate correctly will terminate the connection and log a security event in the central audit trail.
 -  Computer architecture describes the construction of computer components and computer-operated equipment.
 -  All quantities must be reconciled with the initial shipment manifest.


ANSWER

The data content and validation for **S065-B/SRD** are defined as follows:

### 1. **Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs)**
- PRO data must adhere to the **CDISC SDTM standard, version 1.6**.

### 2. **Data Format and Standards**
- All data exchanges must be formatted in accordance with the **HL7 FHIR standard, version R4**, with specific profiles detailed in **Section 3.2**.

### 3. **Data Content Requirements**
- Each record must include:
  - A **unique patient identifier**
  - The **date of response**
  - The **specific instrument used** (e.g., EQ-5D-5L, QLQ-C30)
- The data must include:
  - The **batch number**
  - The **expiration date**
  - A **detailed record** of the product dispensed, returned, or destroyed

### 4. **Validation and Checks**
- A **logical check** is performed to ensure that all response values fall within the permissible range for the specified instrument.
- Any **out-of-range values** will be flagged, and the **entire batch** will be returned for correction with a detailed error report.
- Any **discrepancy greater than a 2% variance** must be justified in a separate discrepancy report submitted alongside the data.
- Failure to provide a valid justification will result in an **official compliance notice**.

### 5. **Data Integrity and Compliance**
- Data integrity is **paramount**, and non-compliance will result in **automated rejection** of the submission.
- Non-compliance (e.g., repeated failed submissions, data integrity issues) may lead to a **formal investigation** and **potential suspension** of the sponsor’s data submission privileges.

### 6. **Authentication and Digital Signatures**
- Each data stream must be accompanied by a **digital signature** using:
  - An **SHA-256 hash**
  - A **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificate** issued by an approved Certificate Authority (CA) as designated in **Appendix A**.

### 7. **Submissions and Limitations**
- **AERs (Adverse Event Reporting)** must use the **MedDRA coding system**, up to the lowest level of term (LLT).
- Submissions exceeding size limits must be **partitioned into multiple files**.
- All data must be **reconciled** with the initial shipment manifest.

### 8. **Scope**
- The scope encompasses all data streams related to **Protocol 734-X**, specifically:
  - Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs)
  - Adverse Event Reporting (AERs)
  - Investigational Product Accountability (IPA) logs

### 9. **Submission and Retention**
- The sponsor is responsible for **retaining a local copy** of all submitted data and the corresponding **transaction IDs**.

This standard ensures secure, compliant, and validated data transfer for clinical trial data, with strict validation rules and accountability measures.
