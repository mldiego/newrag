Threshold/topK: 3


Chunks: 
 -  Computer science spans theoretical disciplines (such as algorithms, theory of computation, and information theory) to applied disciplines (including the design and implementation of hardware and software).
 - 
Computer science is the study of computation, information, and automation.
 -  Algorithms and data structures are central to computer science.


ANSWER

The provided context does not explicitly list the main branches of computer science. It mentions that computer science spans theoretical disciplines (such as algorithms, theory of computation, and information theory) to applied disciplines (including the design and implementation of hardware and software), and that algorithms and data structures are central to the field. However, it does not define or list specific branches. Therefore, based solely on the given information, the main branches of computer science cannot be identified.
