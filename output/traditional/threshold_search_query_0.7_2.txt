Chunks: 
 -  Computer science spans theoretical disciplines (such as algorithms, theory of computation, and information theory) to applied disciplines (including the design and implementation of hardware and software).
 - 
Computer science is the study of computation, information, and automation.
 -  Algorithms and data structures are central to computer science.
 -  The fundamental concern of computer science is determining what can and cannot be automated.The Turing Award is generally recognized as the highest distinction in computer science.
 -  Areas such as operating systems, networks and embedded systems investigate the principles and design behind complex systems.
 -  Human–computer interaction investigates the interfaces through which humans and computers interact, and software engineering focuses on the design and principles behind developing software.
 -  The theory of computation concerns abstract models of computation and general classes of problems that can be solved using them.
 -  The fields of cryptography and computer security involve studying the means for secure communication and preventing security vulnerabilities.
 -  Computer architecture describes the construction of computer components and computer-operated equipment.
 -  Programming language theory considers different ways to describe computational processes, and database theory concerns the management of repositories of data.


ANSWER

The main branches of computer science include:

1. **Theory of Computation** – Concerns abstract models of computation and general classes of problems that can be solved using them.
2. **Algorithms and Data Structures** – Central to computer science, involving the design and analysis of efficient computational methods.
3. **Computer Architecture** – Describes the construction of computer components and computer-operated equipment.
4. **Programming Language Theory** – Considers different ways to describe computational processes.
5. **Database Theory** – Concerns the management of repositories of data.
6. **Operating Systems, Networks, and Embedded Systems** – Investigate the principles and design behind complex systems.
7. **Human–Computer Interaction** – Studies the interfaces through which humans and computers interact.
8. **Software Engineering** – Focuses on the design and principles behind developing software.
9. **Cryptography and Computer Security** – Involves studying secure communication and preventing security vulnerabilities.

These branches span both theoretical and applied disciplines within computer science.
